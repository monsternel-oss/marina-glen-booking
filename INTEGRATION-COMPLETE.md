# Marina Glen Website Integration - Setup Complete! 🎉

## How It Works

### **Main Website First** 
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:3001`
- This automatically shows your "Website Upgrade" main site 
- Full static website with all your beautiful Marina Glen branding

### **Booking System Integration**
- Click any "Book Now" button on the main site
- Opens the React booking platform at: `http://localhost:3001/booking-system`
- Seamless navigation between static site and booking system

## **Navigation Flow**

```
Main Site (http://localhost:3001)
├── Home Page (/main-site/index.html)
├── Attractions (/main-site/attractions.html)
└── Book Now buttons → Booking System (/booking-system)
    ├── Room Selection (/booking-system/rooms)
    ├── Booking Form (/booking-system/booking)
    ├── Booking Preview (/booking-system/booking-form)
    └── Admin Access (/booking-system/admin)
```

## **Key Features**

✅ **Main website loads first** - Professional static site with all content
✅ **"Book Now" opens booking platform** - React app with advanced booking functionality  
✅ **Seamless navigation** - Back buttons return to main site
✅ **Unified branding** - Consistent Marina Glen design throughout
✅ **Single server** - Everything served from localhost:3001

## **File Structure**

```
frontend/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html (redirects to main-site)
│   └── main-site/ (complete Website Upgrade copy)
│       ├── index.html (main homepage)
│       ├── attractions.html
│       ├── images/
│       └── styles/
└── src/ (React booking system)
    ├── App.tsx (routes starting with /booking-system)
    ├── components/
    └── pages/
```

## **Start Development**

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Monster\Desktop\booking copy"
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## **What's Different Now**

**BEFORE**: Booking system was the main page
**NOW**: Static website is the main page, booking system is secondary

**BEFORE**: Users saw React app first  
**NOW**: Users see professional website first, click "Book Now" for advanced features

**BEFORE**: Navigation was confusing between two separate systems
**NOW**: Seamless integration with proper navigation flow

## **Testing the Integration**

1. Visit `http://localhost:3001` - Should see main Marina Glen website
2. Click any "Book Now" button - Should open booking system
3. In booking system, click "Back to Main Site" - Should return to homepage
4. Try "Explore Attractions" - Should show attractions page

## **Production Deployment**

When ready for live deployment:
1. Update all `/booking-system` links to `https://marinaglen.co.za/booking-system`
2. Deploy static files to main domain 
3. Deploy React app to `/booking-system` subdirectory
4. Configure server to serve static files first, React app on booking routes

Perfect integration achieved! 🏖️✨
