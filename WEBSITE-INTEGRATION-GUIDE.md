## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

### **Current Setup Analysis:**
- **Main Website**: Static HTML/CSS (Professional, Fast, SEO-friendly)
- **Booking Platform**: React + Node.js (Advanced, Feature-rich, Secure)
- **Integration Goal**: Seamless user experience between both systems

### **Recommended Integration Architecture:**

- Update React app theme to match main website
- Integrate same fonts, colors, and design language
- Add navigation back to main site
- Maintain branding consistency

### **3. Seamless Navigation**
```html
<!-- Main Website Button -->
<a href="/booking/" class="booking-btn">Book Now</a>

<!-- Booking App Header -->
<nav>
  <a href="/" class="back-to-main">← Back to Marina Glen</a>
  <div class="booking-navigation">...</div>
</nav>
```
